# -CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification
This project uses the Iris dataset to build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. It applies data preprocessing and trains a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. The model achieves high accuracy, demonstrating key concepts in classification, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.
